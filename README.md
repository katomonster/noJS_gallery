# noJS_gallery

noJS_gallery is a gallery that uses no javascript.
It leverages CSS and HTML only.
It is an experiment on how far we can go without javascript.
I love javascript just like anyone else but hey, it's a free world to do what you want, right?
  - This was originally set up as one of the entries for YP's Hackathon 2017
  - A lot of design aspect is not optimal due to time limitations.
  - Most of all this was done for fun and flexing code muscles where it doesn't get used on a daily basis
  - A real-world use might be for AMP
